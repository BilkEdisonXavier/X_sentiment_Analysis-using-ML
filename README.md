# X_sentiment_Analysis-using-ML

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression model to classify tweets as positive or negative.

🚀 Features

Fetches the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle.

Data preprocessing: handling missing values, target mapping, text cleaning, and stemming.

Converts text into numerical representation using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Trains a Logistic Regression model for binary sentiment classification.

Achieves ~77.6% accuracy on the test dataset.

Saves the trained model for future predictions.
